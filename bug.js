This error occurs when using Expo's `Linking` API to handle deep links.  The `Linking.getInitialURL()` method sometimes returns `null` even when a deep link is opened, leading to unexpected behavior in the app.  This is particularly problematic when the app is launched directly from a deep link, as the intended action is never triggered. The issue seems to be intermittent and might be related to the timing of the initial URL retrieval, the Expo client version, or the platform.
